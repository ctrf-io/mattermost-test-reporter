## Setup

You'll need a CTRF report generated by your testing framework. [CTRF reporters](https://github.com/orgs/ctrf-io/repositories) are available for most testing frameworks and easy to install.

**No CTRF reporter? No problem!**

Use [junit-to-ctrf](https://github.com/ctrf-io/junit-to-ctrf) to convert a JUnit report to CTRF.

### Create a MatterMost Incoming Webhook

Go to the [MatterMost API: Incoming Webhooks](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/incoming/) page and follows instructions to setup an incoming webhook. 


### Set the Environment Variable

Set the webhook URL as an environment variable in your shell or CI environment:

```sh
export MATTERMOST_WEBHOOK_URL='https://your/webhook/url'
```

Make sure to replace `'https://your/webhook/url'` with your actual webhook URL.

You might want to store the webhook URL as a secret.

## Usage

To send the test results summary to MatterMost:

```sh
npx mattermost-ctrf results /path/to/ctrf-report.json
```

To send flaky test report to MatterMost:

```sh
npx mattermost-ctrf flaky /path/to/ctrf-report.json
```

### Send Only on Failures

To send the test results summary to MatterMost only if there are failed tests, use the `--onFailOnly` option:

```sh
npx mattermost-ctrf results /path/to/ctrf-file.json --onFailOnly
```

## Options

- `--onFailOnly, -f`: Send notification only if there are failed tests.

## Merge reports

You can merge reports if your chosen reporter generates multiple reports through design, parallelisation or otherwise.

The [ctrf-cli](https://github.com/ctrf-io/ctrf-cli) package provides a method to merge multiple ctrf json files into a single file.

After executing your tests, use the following command:

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory>
```

Replace directory with the path to the directory containing the CTRF reports you want to merge.

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
